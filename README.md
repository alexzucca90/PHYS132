## 1. Introduction
This is an experiment for the PHYS 132 lab at Simon Fraser University. 

I am going to provide some Jupyter notebooks to do the data analysis in the labs. 

Below you find the instructions to run one of the Jupyter notebook on your laptop/computer or what you are actually using. If you don't want to install Python on your laptop (it may take a while to install it), just use the instructions for students with no python. This repository is integrated in Binder.


## 2. Instructions for Students with no Python

At the moment click the Binder launch icon at the top of  this README. You can run the scripts online, although you cannot use your own data at the moment. 

## 3. Instructions for Students with Python
If you want to install Python on your computer you are welcome to do so. If you are majoring Physics, the chances to come across Python in your career will be veryt high. It is the standard in data analysis and it is for free. There are many programs on the market but you'll have to spend some money for it. 

### 3.1. Windows Users
If you have Windows, then just follow the instructions for Students with no Python. I will try to integrate this when I have some more time.

### 3.2. Mac Users

#### 3.2.1. Installing Python
First of all you need to install a Python distribution on your computer. 

#### 3.2.2. Getting a Github Account
Still working on this

#### 3.2.3 Running the Notebooks on your terminal.

To install the software just run this on your terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexzucca90/PHYS132.git
cd PHYS132
```
Now you are in the directory for this course.  From terminal, run the following command:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

You are going to be redirected to your browser on the following page
