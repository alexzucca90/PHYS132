## 1. Introduction
This is an experiment for the PHYS 132 lab at Simon Fraser University. 

I am going to provide some Jupyter notebooks to do the data analysis in the labs.


## 2. Instructions for Students with no Python

Still working on this!

## 3. Instructions for Students with Python

If you have Windows, then just follow the instructions as you did not have python at the moment. 

To install the software just run this on your terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexzucca90/PHYS132.git
cd PHYS132
```
Now you are in the directory for this course. 

From terminal, run 
```bash
jupyter lab
```

On your browser you are going to see a window like this:

and then click on the [warmup.ipynb](/Lab2/warmup.ipynb) notebook as below:
